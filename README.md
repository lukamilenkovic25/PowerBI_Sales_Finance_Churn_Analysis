## What This Portfolio Demonstrates
- End‑to‑end BI workflow: ETL → Modeling → DAX → Reporting  
- Star schema data modeling with fact and dimension tables  
- Business-focused KPI calculations (YTD, YoY, MoM, Variance, Churn Rate)  
- Clear, insight-driven dashboards with drill-downs and interactive filtering  
- Analytical storytelling aimed at business users and management  
- Consistent structuring and documentation of Power BI projects

## Project Structure
Each project folder contains:
- A dedicated README describing the business problem, methodology, and insights  
- Dashboard preview images  
- Power BI (.pbix) file  
- Data model explanation  
- Key DAX measures used in the project  

This ensures clarity, transparency, and repeatability — essential qualities for BI and analytics work.

## Data Models

Below are the data model structures used across all three projects.  
Each model follows a **star schema**, with a central fact table connected to supporting dimension tables, enabling efficient filtering, accurate relationship propagation, and scalable DAX calculations.
